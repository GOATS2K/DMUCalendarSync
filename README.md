# DMUCalendarSync
Sync CampusM/MyDMU calendars with Google Calendar

I assume no one will use this, but in case you do, here's some very minimal documentation.

Ensure you have .NET 6.0 installed and run the following command in the application's directory to run DCS.

```
dotnet run -- <dmu username> <dmu password> <google app client id> <google app client secret>
```
